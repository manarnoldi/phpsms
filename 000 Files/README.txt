Dear Client,

This is how to install the application in your server.

1. Note your database username, password and database name {the default set is root, "" and statevocational}.
2. Go to folder statevocational/includes/constants.php and replace the existing user, password and database values.
3. Paste folder statevocational to your root folder e.g www or htdocs folders.
4. Restore the database by importing the file statevocational.sql which is inside statevocational.
5. Access the folder from the url.
